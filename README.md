 A easy way to get a Raspberry Pi coprocessor to control LEDs over Network Tables

The original idea behind this was because with PhotonVision being the prominent Vision system in FRC it only seemed natural to use the Raspberry Pi as a LED Controller, as providing additional information to the driver is important and having to glance down at a screen can be difficult. This is written to be responsive and reliable, but easy to modify for a team's usecase.
